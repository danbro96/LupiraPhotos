// One spec — the merged BFF surface — in two flavours, because the split is per call site, not per
// app. `query` is for anything read straight off the server; `fetch` is for callers that own their
// own caching: the mobile app's hand-written hooks (persisted to disk for offline viewing) and the
// photo backup queue. Both go through src/transport.ts (`@danbro96/lupira-http`'s seam), which each
// app fills in.
//
// Models are generated once, by the query target, and the fetch target points at the same directory
// so there is a single set of types. `clean` is deliberately off — it would let whichever target
// runs second delete the other's output.
